            <p> Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in outer space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape their grasp if it comes near enough.</p>
            <p> Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. The term "black hole" was coined many years later in 1967 by American astronomer John Wheeler. After decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects, the first physical black hole ever discovered was spotted in 1971.</p>
            <p> Then, in 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the first image ever recorded of a black hole. The EHT saw the black hole in the center of galaxy M87 while the telescope was examining the event horizon, or the area past which nothing can escape from a black hole. The image maps the sudden loss of photons (particles of light). It also opens up a whole new area of research in black holes, now that astronomers know what a black hole looks like.</p>
            <p> So far, astronomers have identified three types of black holes: stellar black holes, supermassive black holes and intermediate black holes.</p>

                <pre><code>print("Hello World");</code></pre>
                <p>This is what a Black Hole would say at this point, right after the death of a supergiant star. I know it a lot to ratiocinate, so let's go slower. We start with a star, it's a giant star, at least 8 times more massive than our sun. After thousands of years it becomes old, at this stage, it started to produce iron at it's core, this is a death sentence because iron uses more energy to be fused than it releases.</p>
                <li><b>The Supernova</b></li>
                <p>The energy that's being used by the fusion process makes the star implode and, right after, explodes in one of the most extremes ways possibles, generating a SuperNova. This explosion creates a molecular cloud that, in the future, can create new stars, planets and be used to feed the new beast created in the middle of this explosion.</p>
                <li><b>The Black Hole</b></li>
                When the star imploded, the pressure was so intense that it created a singularity, the black hole's heart. The energy was so intense that all the matter in the center got smashed together in such a way that there were no more protons, neutrons or electrons, everything just became something new in single point.
