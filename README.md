# My HTML sandbox
## Description
Welcome to my **HTML sandbox**, here I'll star experimenting with basic HTML and CSS concepts
## Files
- **Index.html** is my first digital curriculum, nothing big there (by now), I'll update it as I'm trying new things
- **BlackHoles** don't take this file seriously, it's where I'll throw everything I learn to practice.
- **Calculator folder** Here I'm planning to program a calculator, that's it
