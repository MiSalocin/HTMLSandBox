# My HTML sandbox
## Description
Welcome to my **HTML sandbox**, here I'll star experimenting with basic HTML and CSS concepts
## Files
- **Index.html** is my first digital curriculum, nothing big there (by now), I'll update it as I'm trying new things
- **BlackHoles** don't take this file seriously, it's where I'll throw everything I learn to practice.
- **Calculator folder** Here I'm planning to program a calculator, that's it
## Info
Programmed by Nicolas de Oliveira Correa AKA.: MiSalocin

Long time no see, but nou I have a home server and a domain [here](nicaos.com.br), so maybe, at my free time from my uni, I'll come back to html/js/css programming and work in this site, but for now, it's going to keep being an HTML Sandbox :P
